2 - Write an algorithm (Vehicles.java) that, from reading and storing in vectors the commercial value of 20 vehicles and the type (family (1), public transportation (2), load (3)), 
calculate the value based on:
• For vehicles with a value greater than 100 million, charge VAT of 20%, for others VAT is 16%
• For vehicles type 1, with value up to 50 million, apply a discount equivalent to 50% of the VAT charged
• For vehicles type 2 and 3, with a value higher than 80 million, apply an additional cost of 5%
• For all vehicles, if the final value is less than 80 million, apply an additional discount of 5% of the commercial value
